## **Inspecting the Cultural Web**

### Web technologies and files used

When inspecting the elements in the web browser, I noticed that the website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML tags such as <html> are used to structure the content of the page. For CSS, it is utilized to design and style the page, as shown by use of <style> tags. JavaScript is also used to create an interactive environment, which can be seen through the use of <script> tags and .js files. Apart from .html, .css, and .js, I noticed that there are .svg, .jpg, .png files which are used for the images and logos in the page. From looking at the page, I don’t see any files that I don’t recognize. The page is mostly made up of image-based files. 

### Info on who developed and created the website

In the About section of the website, Hayden Schiff was credited to have created the website with the purpose of allowing free and open access to sports documents. I cannot find any evidence that there is a larger team involved in the development of the website. It seems that there has been only one person involved rather than a company-like effort. Also, from the website, there is a GitHub and a link to the creator’s personal website with more information about his works.
