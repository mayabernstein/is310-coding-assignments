## **American Football Maze**

Maya Bernstein

### What is this maze about?
This maze will cover different aspects of American football to ultimately pinpoint a football player based on the corresponding passages' clues and instructions. 

### Instructions
1. First before entering the maze, if you are a Windows user, refer to the *Note* below to combat any problems with the hidden files. 
2. Next start at the entrance directory of the maze.  
3. From there you would have to locate the right NFL conference. 
4. Next would be the divisons followed by the different teams and ultimately the players. 
5. For each directory, please give the .txt files a read, especially the clues as they may come in handy. 
6. Keep an eye on a secret clue that would be found near the end of the maze. 

### List of Commands
- cd (change and move to a directory)
- ls (look at the list of contents of a directory)
- ls -a or ls -Force (to find the hidden files)
- cat (read files)
- cd .. (to backtrack out of the current directory)

Note: For Windows users, before starting the maze, please run 
.\hide-dotfiles.ps1 in PowerShell so that dotfiles remain hidden unless performing ls -a or ls -Force to make them visible.
